I worked as a gameplay programmer
for [Gnomic Studios](http://www.gnomicstudios.com/) to help them create their
indie game **SquareHeroes** *(2013-2015)*. During this time I supported the game
at PAX AUS (2013 & 2014) by manning the expo booth and making last-minute bug
fixes.

I regularly compete in game jam events like
the [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/)
and [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) and I have experience with a
variety of game development technologies like `Unity3D`, `MonoGame/XNA`,
`LibGDX` and even `HTML5` with `Phaser.js`.
