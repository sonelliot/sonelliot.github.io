I'm a passionate software developer that enjoys writing all sorts of computer
programs, like web apps, video games, command-line tools and so on. I work well
with others and I enjoy learning new technologies and programming languages.

I like to study computer science theory and I'm a strong advocate for
*Functional Programming* style because I think it is our best tool for writing
clean, elegant code. My favourite language is `Lisp`.
