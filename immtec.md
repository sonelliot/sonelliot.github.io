I have been working
at [Immersive Technologies](http://www.immersivetechnologies.com/) since
June, 2010. During that time I have worked on challenging projects and with a
variety of technologies. These are some of the things I worked on:

* worked with a legacy `C++` codebase,
* worked with .NET technologies like `WinForms`, `WPF` and `ASP.NET`,
* helped to improve the depth perception and graphics fidelity in the simulation
  software using `DirectX9` and `HLSL`,
* created and help to maintain several internal tools,
* acted as project lead on several successful projects, 
* developed web applications using modern web technologies (`React.js`,
  `Node.js` etc),
* participated and led several study groups
