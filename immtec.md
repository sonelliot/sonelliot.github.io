I have worked at [Immersive Technologies](http://www.immersivetechnologies.com/)
since June, 2010. During this time I have participated in a variety of
challenging projects and worked with a range of technologies. Examples of this
include:

* working with a legacy `C++` codebase,
* working with .NET technologies such as `WinForms`, `WPF` and `ASP.NET`,
* helping to improve the depth perception and graphics fidelity of the
  simulation software using `DirectX9` and `HLSL`,
* developing and maintaining internal tools,
* acting as project lead on several successful projects, 
* developing web applications using modern web technologies (`React.js`,
  `Node.js` etc) and,
* participating and leading study groups.
