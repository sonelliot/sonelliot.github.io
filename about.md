I'm a passionate software developer who enjoys creating exciting and innovative
programs, such as web apps, video games and command-line tools. I work well with
others and I enjoy learning new technologies and programming languages.

I like to study computer science theory and I'm a strong advocate for
*Functional Programming* style because I think it is our best tool for writing
clean, elegant code. My favourite language is `Lisp`.
